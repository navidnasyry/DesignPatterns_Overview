# Design Patterns: Essential Design Patterns

Welcome to the ultimate guide on **7 essential design patterns** that every developer should know. This repository is crafted to help you understand and apply core design principles in software development using real-world examples and practical explanations.

---

## Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices refined over years by experienced software engineers. Using design patterns:

* Promotes code reuse and scalability.
* Enhances communication among team members through common vocabulary.
* Leads to robust and maintainable systems.

---

## When to Use Design Patterns?

Use design patterns when:

* You encounter recurring design issues.
* You want to improve code maintainability and flexibility.
* You aim to enforce architectural best practices.
* Youâ€™re designing systems requiring extensibility and modularity.

---

## Advantages of Design Patterns

* **Reusability:** Solutions can be reused across multiple projects.
* **Best Practices:** Patterns are time-tested and well-documented.
* **Improved Communication:** Shared terminology simplifies collaboration.
* **Efficient Development:** Reduces time spent solving common design issues.
* **Code Maintainability:** Patterns result in clearer and more understandable code.

## Important Design Patterns

### 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and dynamic.

#### [A. Builder](./Creational/Builder/ReadMe.md)

The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn't require products to have a common interface. It allows you to create different representations of an object using the same construction process. A classic example is building a meal or a house, where different configurations are required but the process remains similar.

#### [B. Factory](./Creational/Factory/ReadMe.md)

The Factory pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's used when the exact type of the object isn't known until runtime. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into your code.

#### [C. Singleton](./Creational/Singleton/ReadMe.md)

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It's commonly used for shared resources like configurations, logging, or caching. The key benefit is controlled access to the sole instance, which is lazily initialized and prevents unnecessary duplication.

### 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure does not need to do the same.

#### [A. Adapter](./Structural/Adapter/ReadMe.md)

The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces. This is especially useful when integrating new components into existing systems without changing their source code. Think of it as a power plug adapter that lets a device from one country fit into a different socket.

#### [B. Facade](./Structural/Facade/ReadMe.md)

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. This is like a carâ€™s dashboard that provides easy controls to start and operate the vehicle, while hiding complex underlying mechanisms.

---

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects. They help manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities among objects.

#### [A. Observer](./Behavioral/Observer/ReadMe.md)

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is commonly used in event-driven systems, such as news feeds, notification services, or GUI frameworks.

#### [B. Strategy](./Behavioral/Strategy/ReadMe.md)

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. This is useful in scenarios like payment processing or navigation apps where different methods can be selected at runtime.
