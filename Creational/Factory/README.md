## üè≠ Factory Pattern ‚Äì In Practice

### üìù When to Use Factory

The **Factory Pattern** is ideal when:

* You need to create objects **without specifying their exact class**.
* The creation logic is **complex, conditional**, or requires **encapsulation**.
* You want to **centralize and manage instantiation**, especially when dealing with inheritance or interfaces.

üì¶ **Example Scenario**: Suppose you‚Äôre developing a graphics editor that supports multiple shapes like `Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle`. You don‚Äôt want to write `new Circle()` or `new Square()` everywhere. Instead, use a factory to create shapes based on user input.

### ‚úÖ With Factory Pattern (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
#include <string>

// Product interface
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const = 0;
    virtual ~Shape() {}
};

// Concrete products
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a Circle\n";
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a Square\n";
    }
};

// Factory
class ShapeFactory {
public:
    static std::unique_ptr<Shape> createShape(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "circle") return std::make_unique<Circle>();
        else if (type == "square") return std::make_unique<Square>();
        else return nullptr;
    }
};

// Usage
int main() {
    auto shape1 = ShapeFactory::createShape("circle");
    auto shape2 = ShapeFactory::createShape("square");

    shape1->draw();
    shape2->draw();

    return 0;
}
```

### ‚ùå Without Factory Pattern

```cpp
int main() {
    std::string userInput = "circle";
    Shape* shape;

    if (userInput == "circle") {
        shape = new Circle();
    } else if (userInput == "square") {
        shape = new Square();
    }

    shape->draw();
    delete shape;

    return 0;
}
```

## üö´ Disadvantages of Not Using Factory

When you **don't** use the Factory pattern in the right place:

1. **Tight Coupling:**

   * Classes are directly dependent on concrete classes instead of abstractions, reducing flexibility.

2. **Scattered Object Creation Logic:**

   * `new` expressions are repeated in multiple places. If the logic changes (e.g., you add caching or logging), you need to update many areas.

3. **Hard to Maintain or Extend:**

   * Adding a new shape (like `Triangle`) requires changes across multiple files or locations.

4. **Violation of Open/Closed Principle:**

   * Modifying client code each time a new type is added violates the principle of being open for extension but closed for modification.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Builder vs Factory

If you're wondering about using **Builder vs Factory**, here's the distinction:

| Use Case            | Builder                         | Factory                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Object Complexity   | High (multi-step creation)      | Low to medium (focus on type selection) |
| Object Variants     | Same process, different outputs | Different objects from a selection pool |
| Control Granularity | Fine-grained                    | Coarse-grained                          |
