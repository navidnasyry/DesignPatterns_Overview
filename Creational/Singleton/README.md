### 🧩 Singleton Pattern – In Practice

#### 📝 When to Use Singleton

Use the Singleton Pattern when:

* You need exactly **one instance** of a class globally accessible across your system.
* The object holds a **shared resource** (e.g., configuration manager, logger, cache, thread pool).
* You want to control instantiation and access centrally.

### ✅ With Singleton Pattern (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Logger {
private:
    Logger() {}  // Private constructor
    Logger(const Logger&) = delete;
    Logger& operator=(const Logger&) = delete;

public:
    static Logger& getInstance() {
        static Logger instance; // Guaranteed to be destroyed, instantiated on first use
        return instance;
    }

    void log(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << "[Log]: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Logger::getInstance().log("System initialized.");
    Logger::getInstance().log("User login successful.");
    return 0;
}
```

### ❌ Without Singleton Pattern

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Logger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) {
        std::cout << "[Log]: " << message << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Logger logger1;
    Logger logger2;

    logger1.log("Start application.");
    logger2.log("This is a separate logger instance.");

    return 0;
}
```

### 🚫 Disadvantages of Not Using Singleton

1. **Duplicate Instances:**

   * Creating multiple logger/config instances may lead to inconsistent data or resource waste.

2. **Uncontrolled Access:**

   * Any part of the code can create and manage their own instance, increasing complexity.

3. **Synchronization Issues:**

   * Without a global control point, synchronizing access to shared resources becomes more difficult.

4. **Harder to Enforce Single Responsibility:**

   * Shared utilities like loggers should not be duplicated or scattered.

---

### ⚠️ Caution When Using Singleton

Despite its benefits, Singleton has drawbacks if **overused**:

* It introduces **global state**, which can make code **harder to test**.
* It may **hide dependencies**, making code less modular.
* It can become a **bottleneck** in multithreaded systems if not implemented carefully.
